# 30-day-Python-learning-journey
ChatGPT makes me a coding routine to become ML master

I asked ChatGPT to give me exact 30 day plan to learn PYtohn coding with emphasis on machine learning. I already have basic Python skills and a little of ML skills. 

I will edit this readme daily and add my projects.
After 30 days I will probably extend this challenge.

1: Setting up GitHub account and adding this repo.

2: Write a script that prints a multiplication table.

3: Write a simple calculator in Python.
